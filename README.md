# Face Recognition Voting System

This project is a **Face Recognition Voting System** designed to ensure secure, fast, and fraud-proof elections by verifying voters through facial biometrics.

## Features
- **Facial Authentication:** Verifies voter identity using face recognition technology.
- **Secure Voting:** Prevents duplicate voting and voter fraud.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive for voters.
- **Real-time Verification:** Voter identity is authenticated in real-time.
- **Scalable:** Can be integrated into various election systems, from small to large-scale implementations.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** 
- **CSS** 
- **JAVASCRIPT** 

  
## How It Works
1. **Voter Registration:** Voters are registered in the system with their facial data.
2. **Voting Process:** Voters scan their face to log in, and the system authenticates their identity.
3. **Vote Casting:** After successful authentication, voters can cast their votes.
4. **Result Compilation:** Votes are securely counted and stored in the database.
